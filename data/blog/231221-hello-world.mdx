# Introduction 

Welcome 👋 and thank you for visiting my website! 
It's still in its early stages 🚧 and there's not much content nor interactions but expect more in the coming weeks. 
I plan to include more features while consistently blogging. I want to be accountable in my learning journey while being able to contribute to the world, 
no matter how small. What better way to do it than by reading or watching a new topic, trying it out, and sharing my personal hands on experience about it. 
This way, I can have better retention, understand it through actual hands on exercises, 
fully grasping the whole thing, and then helping other people digest it through my own examples and perspective.


# Technology Background

In this site, I'll mainly be covering – 🖥️🧑🏻‍💻 technology and 🏃🏼🏋️ fitness with a couple of character development posts. 
I've been a Software Engineer and IT Project Manager for the past 10 years while co-founding a startup called [Fitscovery](https://fitscovery.com). 
I'm currently the CTO (Chief Technology Officer) of that company. 
I'm a geek so I enjoy reading and watching about software engineering, cloud computing, AI, start ups, and anything under the tech industry. 

Our advancements have always left me in awe especially on how fast we create new things and make our lives easier through tech. 
For example, with the exponential growth of the AI industry with the likes of [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/explore), 
we've seen people finish hours of work in creating or editing a photo to just a few minutes. 
AI was one of the hottest topics at the start of 2023 but even though it's almost 2024, 
it's still grabbing headlines here and there. I'll be touching more about this specific IT field in my future posts.

# Fitness Background

Fitness has always been a vital part of who I am. I would always start or end my day with a workout whether it may be 
running, lifting weights, mobilitiy exercises, stretching, engaging in team sports or even as simple as doing breathing exercises.
It has changed my life for the better despite the numerous setbacks in my overall health. That is even why I did a startup with a good friend
from [Sun's Out Fitness](https://www.instagram.com/sunsoutfitness/) wherein the main focus is in the fitness industry. 

# Moving Forward

As I create more content in my site, I aim to share how my love for tech intersects with my passion for fitness. 
A lot of the small projects I will be making and showcasing here will be fitness centric with a couple of random
projects here and there that tackles the latest advancements I'm into. I hope you enjoy my future posts and the
journey of learning with me. Feel free to message me, provide feedback, ask questions, and give suggestions. I'll
be more than happy to interact and learn new things from you.

Regards,

F 👊🏻
